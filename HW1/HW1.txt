Homework Assignment 1.

1.Egg problem
   Steps:
           1.Drop one egg from the middle level of the building.

           2.If the egg breaks or does not break eliminate the possiblity of
             the other levels corresponding.
  
           3.Then drop the egg from the middle level of the remaining levels
             if there is no middle level then drop it form the next
             remaining possible level.
   
           4.Repeat step 2 and 3 until you have found the lowest level that breaks
             the egg.     
           

2.Work algorithm 
   Steps:
           1.User input start date of work week.

           2.User input end date of work week (must be 4 weeks apart).

           3.User input of sick days if and when. If sick day one is earlier
             than week 2 of work week then calculate that as unqualified
             work day. Do this again if second sick day is before week 4.
           
           4.Add up the hours such that every week is 40 hours and every day
             is 8 horus then subtract any unqualified sick days.
          
           5.Divide total hours by 4 if the result is less than 30 there is
             no (OP) if it is more than 30 then it is base pay multiplied by 1.5. If it 
             is over 40 but under 80 then its base pay multiplied by 2.0. If it is over
             80 then the subject is fired.

           6.If employee works 40 hours overtime and only took one sick day
             they get thier base pay multiplied by 30.

           7.Display output.    


3.Lexicographic difference. 
   Steps:
         1.Assume all lowercase letters have the values 97 through 122
            starting with a.
          
         2.Assume all uppercase letters have the value 65 through 90
           starting at A.
 
         3.Assume all cases where the words are the same become null.

         4.User inputs two words.

         5.From left to right compare both words until finding a different
           letter
     
         6.Subtract the numerical value of said letters if one word is
           longer have the space where a letter should be located on the end of the
           word become the null value.
         
         7.Take the absolute value of that difference.

         8.Display output.
